Strange Darling has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

Strange Darling is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a Strange Darling movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent Strange Darling franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in Strange Darling and Strange Darling 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to Strange Darling details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.

Strange Darling Releases In Theaters On Aug 25, 2024

Available In Several Premium Formats, The exclusive theatrical release of Strange Darling begins on July 26, 2024. It is the MCU's first R-rated movie, which means that anyone under the age of 17 is required to be accompanied by an adult if watching Strange Darling in theaters. This rating is largely due to the no-holds-barred violence that typifies Strange Darling's cinematic career, but strong language and sexual references are also to be expected.

The movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 7 minutes and features one post-credits scene. This makes it the longest Strange Darling movie to date, with Strange Darling coming in at 1 hour 48 minutes and Strange Darling 2 hitting 1 hour and 59 minutes. Strange Darling is available to watch in IMAX, 4DX, and other premium formats, which promise to deliver the full impact of seeing the heroes engaging in the MCU's most brutal fight sequences.

Strange Darling Streaming Release Date?

Strange Darling will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for Strange Darling. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, Strange Darling would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'Strange Darling' in Theaters?

Yes, Strange Darling will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel Strange Darling did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Strange Darling, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Strange Darling, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'Strange Darling'?

The release of Strange Darling may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Strange Darling and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Strange Darling (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will Strange Darling Release On Streaming?

Strange Darling Will Stream On Disney Plus. There is no official word on when Strange Darling will be available to stream. As it is officially part of the MCU, it will almost certainly be exclusively available on Disney Plus later this year, which currently houses the vast majority of MCU productions and the movies that were once part of Fox's X-Men franchise.

Strange Darling has generated an incredible level of hype, and will likely remain in theaters for as long as possible as it sticks the landing with critics. This is even more possible given that it will be the only MCU movie of 2024, leaving the road wide open until Captain America: Brave New World releases on February 14, 2025. With that in mind, Marvel Studios will likely want to capitalize on the box office revenue of Strange Darling for as long as possible, possibly even relishing in the latest billion-dollar MCU movie.

When Will Strange Darling Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before Strange Darling is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when Strange Darling will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest. This format should come with behind-the-scenes featurettes and other extra features like gag reels, though the full details of what it will contain has to be confirmed.
